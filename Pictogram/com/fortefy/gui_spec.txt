GUI basic requirements:

	1. Define NoteEventSets and store them in registers
	2. Apply transforms to NESs
	3. Pass NESs into processors & store the results or pass them into other processors
	4. Save workspace in our format and read back in later
	5. Render as MIDI etc
	
GUI Ideas:
	Piano keyboard for pitch class entry
	Show PCs on a staff; will need 12 little graphics with the lines and a dot (+ accidental)
		Allow user to change the staff
