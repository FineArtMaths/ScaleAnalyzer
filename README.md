# ScaleAnalyzer

This project consists of:
* some Python code that's useful for working with scales and "microtonal" tunings;
* a collection of Scala tuning files;
* the "source code" of [my free scales ebook](https://archive.org/details/ScaleAndArpeggioResourcesAGuitarEncyclopedia), which is mostly used as a source of 12EDO scale names.

You can find more information about some of this stuff, and get a sense of why I play around with it, on [my blog](https://cochranemusic.com/). You can listen to my music, which uses some of this stuff, [on Bandcamp](https://richcochrane.bandcamp.com/).
