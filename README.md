# ScaleAnalyzer

This project consists of:
* some Python code that's useful for working with scales and "microtonal" tunings;
* a collection of Scala tuning files;
* the "source code" of [my free scales ebook](https://archive.org/details/ScaleAndArpeggioResourcesAGuitarEncyclopedia), which is mostly used as a source of 12EDO scale names.

You can find more information about some of this stuff, and get a sense of why I play around with it, on [my blog](https://cochranemusic.com/). You can listen to my music, which uses some of this stuff, [on Bandcamp](https://richcochrane.bandcamp.com/).

Needless to say (but here it comes anyway) this code is intended for my own use and is provided here without any warranty of any kind. If you intend to run this code please first make sure you fully understand it and fix the bugs that might otherwise cause problems.

**Note for panicking musos** If you don't know what this website is and just want the Scala files, click the big green Code button above and choose the download option. You'll get a ZIP file with the code (which you won't care about) and the Scala files all wrapped up in a neat bundle.
